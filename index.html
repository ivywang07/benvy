		<div>Resume
</div>
		<div>Age: 27</div>
		<div>A mommy of 2 kids younger one 3~6 months</div>
		<div>All</div>
		<div>A mommy of a 4-yr-old boy, pregnant for 3 month </div>
		<div>#F87B72 - Button Background</div>
		<div>One user mentioned she would like to know what other people bought the most or what were famous products among other parents.
</div>
		<div>To confirm our target user group has this pain point, we did an observation around baby-stuff shelves in Target, finding out that most of people spending a long time on choosing merchandise. Then we carried out user interview and survey to deeply dig out how is the decision-making process that our target users are going through.
</div>
		<div>\Data 
</div>
		<div>We Select High-Quality Tips for You.
</div>
		<div>Lack of experience on a new product is one of the answers. When we have no idea which one to purchase, we constantly seek advice from various resources like recommendations from our friends or popular people on the internet, customer reviews and so on.
</div>
		<div>• Insure good physical conditions for the baby and herself.
• Get prepared for her coming baby
</div>
		<div>Problem 1: How to Purchase?
</div>
		<div>\Information Architecture
</div>
		<div>4. Parents think highly of friends’ recommondations.

</div>
		<div>Character: Pregant for 5 months
</div>
		<div>Based on your babies’ ages and history search record.
</div>
		<div>We reorganized all data gathered from user research into an affinity diagram and found out that there were substantial common shopping patterns exsiting among our participants.

</div>
		<div>Untrustworthy
</div>
		<div>\Personas
</div>
		<div>Since this product is around baby stuff, we want the app to create a cozy environment. So we chose a warm color-red, as our theme color and neutral color to deliver a clean and simple interface.
</div>
		<div>Benvy
</div>
		<div>A better solution:
</div>
		<div>Three participants pointed out that they wanted to directly buy or know where to buy the products mentioned in tips.
</div>
		<div>\Screens
</div>
		<div>#848484 - Button Color</div>
		<div>We separately created personas for parents-to-be and new parents to internalize the different goals, needs and wants of two groups.
</div>
		<div>New Parent: Jason Tonks 
</div>
		<div>Different situations
</div>
		<div>• Often go shopping with no results.
• Take friends’ recommendations.
• Ralely write review.
</div>
		<div>01Homepage
</div>
		<div>Problem 2: What products are populoar?
</div>
		<div>One specific group of people who may also encounter this phenomenon is new parents and parents to-be. They have zero experience but need to buy all sorts of stuff for their new babies. </div>
		<div>Goal</div>
		<div>Weca$h</div>
		<div>2. Parents always get confused about what they need to prepare for their babies due to zero experience in parenting. 

 




</div>
		<div>• As his daughter gradually growing up, he get confused what she should use in different age. 
• Sometimes deceived by advertisements or online business articles.
• Bought some products unuseful, even if they had good reviews online.
</div>
		<div>Writters could be paid by some companies to say something good about their products, not real experience.

 




</div>
		<div>A better solution: Purchase link 
</div>
		<div>Two serious problems of online information:
</div>
		<div>Instantly Get Instructions from Experienced Parents
</div>
		<div>Parent-to-be: Laura Smith
</div>
		<div>\The Problem
</div>
		<div>\My Role
</div>
		<div>• Zero experience in parenting, have no idea about what maternal & baby stuff to purchase. 
• Overwhelmed by hundreds of similar products, like pacifiers, hard to decide which one is better.

</div>
		<div>Location: Brooklyn, NY
</div>
		<div>We have considered to develop our app to an e-commercial platform when we have a large customer base. But for now, a substitution is to provide a purchase link. To avoid being regarded as ads for certian companies, the hiden link can only be seen with one more click.  
</div>
		<div>02Homepage
</div>
		<div>At the very beginning of the development, we can provide the rank of best sellers offering by other platform when searching, which somehow solves this problem. As long as we obtain more tips posted by users, we will provide a rank according to the times of one products mentioned in tips.
</div>
		<div>\Improvement
</div>
		<div>2. Build empathy and sympathy on target users, figure out their needs, desires, pain points, and frustrations. 



</div>
		<div>
</div>
		<div>1. Parents become more careful when they are picking products for their babies than themselves.

 




</div>
		<div>• Find interesting stuff for his daughter.
• Provide high life quality to his daughter.
</div>
		<div>Ideation
</div>
		<div>Have you ever felt hard to choose the color of a lipstick, or a new laptop when shopping? Why does this happen?
</div>
		<div>Anylsis
</div>
		<div>We reflected 2 groups’ current decision-making process in on journey map to examine present, highlight painpoints and uncover possible opportunities to building a better search experience. 
</div>
		<div>Log In
</div>
		<div>Final Design
</div>
		<div>1. Understand why, what and how target users get advice when making purchase desicions on maternal & baby stuff.

How can we make it easier and more enjoyable when making purchase decisions on maternal & baby stuff?
